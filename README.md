# Eaton MIBs and template for Zabbix

This repository is for all [Zabbix](zabbix.com/) lovers and who are using Eatons ATS (Automatic transfer switch) and their 9PX UPS series.
I use them at work and wants to monitor them, but there wasn't a template available which covered everything so I needed to create my own.


## What's inside?

This repository contains MIBs [Management information base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_information_base) and templates for following devices by Eaton.
- 9PX 6000i
- EATS16N
- EATS30N
